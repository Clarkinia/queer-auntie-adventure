&lt;p&gt;A major theme of the year is understanding who is in your circle and how to care for each other (north node in cancer). Folks are feeling eager to understand and explore new perspectives and deepen understanding of cultural differences (jupiter in sagittarius). This is a good year to collaborate on creative projects that raise awareness and encourage a compassionate, socially responsible, democratic spirit of solidarity (sextiles of saturn to neptune). This month is ideal for starting commitments on projects and relationships that steadily create lasting, beautiful objects. (mars and uranus in taurus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Capricorn at high noon&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are moving towards a power and control reckoning in early 2020 that carries great potential for transformation as well as destruction (saturn conj pluto in cap). For the past ten years “the system” has been undergoing abrupt and intense re-structuring through crisis (pluto in cap). It’s not moving fast enough for many of us! As the historical roots and core foundation of our white supremacist patriarchy are called into question, the systemic dirty laundry is being aired and authoritarianism is re-emerging (south node in cap).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clarkiniaastrology.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/wild_chalk.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluto is trying to muscle through to nudge and topple corruption in the system. Pluto through Cap keeps it real, walks right in and presses the “DO NOT PRESS” button. Pluto overturns tables at the family reunion to test everyone’s mettle and bring those who survive closer together. It all started in 2008 with the collapse of the unregulated financial market, the billions in bailouts, the mortgage scams, credit freezes, the stock market crash (pluto first entered cap). The Occupy movement in 2011 “expressed opposition to social and economic inequality and to the lack of “real democracy” around the world”(uranus entered aquarius). Other movements like #blacklivesmatter and #metoo have courageously called out the lies of high status individuals to demand justice and to rewrite our system, to create a safer conditions to secure a chance for everyone to succeed (jupiter in libra, scorpio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clarkiniaastrology.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/snail_chalk.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the system being called into crisis. In neutral terms, Capricorn methodically controls the conditions to teach behaviors that benefit society. It creates the systems of punishment and reinforcement. It supervises the flow of power, sets a reliable foundation for society to thrive on and establishes the structure for rewards, payment, prominence and important goals. Capricorn supports step-by-step procedures to accomplish tangible goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the two biggest power and control planets, Saturn and Pluto, in Capricorn, we have the potential to deeply restructure our systems. Try not to hold things in, especially emotional firestorms or long-held secrets. Own your power, set boundaries and try to be as practical and responsible as you know you’re supposed to be. Pluto demands emotional truth in relationships, and always keeps tabs on the life/death hot buttons to leverage power. Saturn wants everyone to comply to the organized system of duties, tasks and time cards. However you can get these two parts of you to get along… I mean if you know how, fill me in okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;2019 so far&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;January: a sober look at what success means to you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was a personal state of the union reality check: you looked at what you want to accomplish in this life and how to get there. You made realistic, do-able steps to get there, while eliminating the noise of outside ideas of what you should be doing. Also paying no mind to last-minute worries to “catch up” or to try to prove the value of what you know to be your path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;February: impulsive activity aligned with a sense of self&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You rambunctiously connected with others to make something totally fucking rad, tapping into that inner teenager that knows every-fuckin-thing! There was a strong urge to break free of conformity. You followed truth-fueled, aggressive, weird, new wilderness, hair up ass, high energy breakthroughs and a feeling of being reinvigorated to live by an unpredictable, individualistic, yet altruistic urge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;March: sit with your feelings while you tune your relationship guitar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Steeping in a magical brew of listening to others, telling others how you feel and noticing where you like more or less. A time of beginnings and endings and returns and releases. Lots of overlap of new and old cycles, harmonizing with different feelings, relationships, roles. Finding comfort in uncomfortable situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Right Brain&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to your favorite songs from years ago. Sing songs from your childhood. Sing songs with your family and friends. If you’re a musician, write a new song. Write a poem. Let your senses mix and match. Write a poem for a taste. Make a sound for a smell (like how farts smell and sound together, but try different ones since that one is already taken). Make a dance for a color. Make a mixtape. Cry, drink wine in the bath and listen to music. Walk in the rain while listening to music. Serenade your love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Steps to dancing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up dancing polka with my Slovak family. I used to brush up on my polka skills with a polka video from the Berkeley Public Library. I have taken different dance classes through the years, including lots of ballet as a little kid and Haitian dance at Laney College. Going out dancing is like church to me. I have always wanted to take salsa with my Puerto Rican hunk because Veronica always schools me when we dance. I’ve always wanted to go to lesbian line dancing at a bar - I’m 42-years-old and I still haven’t! What the actual hay! I’m supposed to be taking a hip hop class with my friend, Emily, but I keep flaking. I’m never not dancing in my house and while I drive and while I shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is there are many ways to do it.

&lt;p&gt;In 2003 I started volunteering at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityslickerfarms.org&quot;&gt;City Slicker Farms,&lt;/a&gt; an urban farm that has been at the forefront of the food justice movement. Back then it was a couple of single-lot farms and a handful of backyard gardens. I often worked alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/title/essential-urban-farmer/oclc/781618683&quot;&gt;Willow Rosenthal,&lt;/a&gt; who showed me the ropes. At first, I was all fired up to pull every last weed to help the plants grow more efficiently. That’s when Willow taught me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farmersalmanac.com/companion-planting-guide-31301&quot;&gt;companion planting,&lt;/a&gt; a practice of creating a habitat by allowing different plants (including “weeds”) to grow next to each other. These plant pairings help each other grow better and protect each other from pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
En Vogue have done some light weeding and replanting in the past.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These next few weeks, you will be tending to your weed people, deciding which you’re ready to pull and which to root in deeper with. People from your past will resurface, if they haven’t already. As you re-acquaint yourselves, you will re-consider these relationships. Depending on where Pisces is in your chart, this can cover your chosen family, your soul pod, creative collaborators, mentors, neighbors, social media friends, co-workers or people with shared investments. You will be face-to-face with deciding which binds you want to break free of and which lasting commitments you want to make last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/car_smoker.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
Will they last?
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Everyone's favorite astrological topic&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all you draculas who have been cringe-fully jogging in the park in the middle of the day wondering when all these direct planets will shift, adjust your fangs because at long last we have mercury going retrograde! Get ye to a velvety coffin and let the introspective games begin. And for those outward-energy care bears who fear retrogrades, you’ll be fine I’m sure. After all you have plenty of car karaoke and celebrity dance shows to get you through the minefield of paper cuts that is retrogrades (me: shudders with joy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lil astro tip: don’t fret about the merc retro: it’s good for retracing steps: getting a second chance to learn and do inner work. (triple salcolon, never done before) This retrograde you can expect people coming back into your life, replaying old roles or reconsidering old career paths. Mercury retrograding in Pisces is high vibes and you can get a lot of power from following that flickering light of intuition. Do not ignore your body, heart and soul messages. Get with that inner voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Being with people is a muscle&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I went to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticalresistance.org/abolition-of-policing-workshop/&quot;&gt;Critical Resistance workshop&lt;/a&gt; about how to use de-escalation skills instead of relying on 9-11 in conflict situations. We were counted out into groups and each group was asked to come up with ways to resolve a different scenario. My group’s example was getting in a fender bender with somebody who was just released on parole. The solution my group arrived at relied on &lt;a href=&quot;https://compression.org/jackson-rising-kali-akuno-ajamu-nangwaya/&quot;&gt;community resources, like mentors and time-banking, that promote accountability through cooperative trust.&lt;/a&gt; But that involves real skills that take time to develop, an investment that would need to be sustained by continually assessing the needs of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cooperationjackson.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/cooperation.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
In Jackson, MI, Cooperation Jackson is &quot;an emerging vehicle for sustainable community development, economic democracy, and community ownership.&quot;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to work together, stay present and connect with others seems like a skill worth investing in. It’s the urskill, the original skill, the skill to end all skills. At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticalresistance.org/abolition-of-policing-workshop/&quot;&gt;Critical Resistance workshop,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmgallardo.com/contact.html&quot;&gt;educator and workshop co-presenter, German&lt;/a&gt; said, “When we rely on policing to solve all our problems, collective problem solving atrophies. We need to practice in order to sustain the innate abilities we have around conflict resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to trust and communicate in confusing situations is a skill that takes practice. Throughout the day it is a constant practice of self awareness that helps me stay present. And being aware of others is another area I am always working on. Some things that I do to raise my awareness of others is to get eye contact, slow down to feel where they are coming from, listen more patiently and ask questions when I don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/community-action-team-training-tickets-56730361037&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/yjc_skits.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
Members of Youth Justice Coalition in Los Angeles provide Community Action Team Trainings where they teach practical skills to de-escalate situations you may encounter in everyday life. You can register now for the April 6 and 7 session (I will be there).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I cut myself off from my feelings. I realize it happens when I memorize a bunch of new information or scroll through Instagram. It can feel good to spend time being more logical and impersonal, but often it’s just a byproduct of overworking, overthinking and taking on too much. When I allow myself to be back in my body, the feeling of tenderness and sweetness can cause me to overflow with emotion. Sometimes the same thing happens when I listen and connect with another person. It’s like while I was spending time in logic town, all my emotions were quietly welling up, my need to give and receive care and special attention patiently waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-presenters Jess and German began the Critical Resistance workshop by affirming our abilities to take care of ourselves (get water, tea, coffee or step outside to take a breather). And they invited us to ask for help if we need it. German led a group activity where we called all of our selves into the room. We called the pieces of us that might still be out in other parts of this city, lost in the past or roaming the skies. He said, “True change happens when we share ideas and for that to happen we need all the parts of you to be in the room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
Piscean things: groups, play, memory, childhood and dreamspaces.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, even though you may feel harried by some of the repeated circumstances and people coming back into your life, they are likely exactly what you recently asked for. There is a reason you’re trying this out again. Ask yourself why you want this; don’t be afraid to sit with that feeling. The reason might be foggy, but true, and you just have to follow it a bit. But if you sit with it and know it’s wrong, then by all means say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With delicate high vibes so it’s easy to get panicked and wish things made more linear sense. Unhealthy expression of Pisces gets sneaky, martyry, resentful, evasive, touchy, victimy and calls 9-11. Especially with the sun in Pisces, watch for a humble-brag show of compassionate and sensitive Piscean traits while hiding vulnerable things like negative emotions and avoiding direct communication about personal needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy Pisces is trusting, sharing, connecting and sitting with feelings. Tell people what you feel, even if your emotions are more in flux than usual. Touch in with how you and everyone else is in a vulnerable spot, just being alive. You don’t need to have everything figured out now; it might make sense in the end. Enjoy the altered perspective while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

on quiet, hot days in Southern California. &lt;br /&gt;
The sidewalk makes its move to dehydrate &lt;br /&gt;
back to cement powder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crows and Lantana &lt;br /&gt;
glide their skeletons at the sun. &lt;br /&gt;
Dashboard covers hardly shield the heat. &lt;br /&gt;
Even the basement is hot with the sun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lantana glows easily &lt;br /&gt;
towards it, &lt;br /&gt;
as if the sun were a &lt;br /&gt;
cool, moss-edged pool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crows glare back at the glare &lt;br /&gt;
to measure the cat’s eye &lt;br /&gt;
against other marbles, &lt;br /&gt;
buttons and round shiny things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crow collects, sorts &lt;br /&gt;
and radiates it onto the lawn, &lt;br /&gt;
like a grandparent’s knitting pattern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to look at it. &lt;br /&gt;
Your arms dangle like hot seatbelts. &lt;br /&gt;
Your skin wrinkles more rapidly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeins on the lawn &lt;br /&gt;
connecting one corner &lt;br /&gt;
of skin to the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here’s a little activity for this week. you will need a paper and pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;what is one way in which you are both mis-understood and ahead of your time? (awaken, teen angst)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;you hold the key to how things could be more fair for everyone. write it down in a 3-word manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;draw your personal ID symbol based on your 3-word manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with ball-point pen, draw your symbol on your arm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this week, scavenge for another person’s manifesto, but don’t ask them outright. see if you can glean it. listen to their way, what is special about them, what makes them tick, their foods, customs and the way they show thanks. listen closely and with deeper sensitivity than ever. listen so close that you could play a drum solo of their heart and breath. be a guest at their table. notice how they do things in a way you would have never considered. draw and write your findings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Planetary mumbo-jumbo for astro nerds&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standouts this month are Aquarius and its ruling planet, Uranus. Both the Sun and Mercury are in Aquarius through mid-February. Uranus is doing its victory lap in Aries before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/astrology/uranus-enters-taurus&quot;&gt;going back into Taurus&lt;/a&gt; in March. Uranus has been firing up this new sense of identity over the last eight-ish years in Aries, aggressively powering through into a radical new design. We have lots of exciting aspects to Uranus coming up in the next couple weeks. The Venus trine is making it about relationships, tone, design, rhythm and finding a way to bring some connectivity and sweetness to the freakazoid new individual flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Uranus, Mars is also finishing its (much shorter) run in Aries. Mars kicked off the month with a square to Pluto and will be conjunct Mars on Feb 13, which promises to be off the hook weirdo energy, cumming like a pinball machine on another planet flashing TILT and like smoke is everywhere. At any rate, it should be a good day for online porn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Regina Clarkinia</name></author><category term="Astrology" /><category term="Activities" /><category term="Tattoo" /><category term="Uranus" /><category term="Transits" /><summary type="html">the tattoo: an astro activity here’s a little activity for this week. you will need a paper and pen.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22john_walter.jpg%22,%20%22teaser%22=%3Enil,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22not%20really%20sure%20why%20but%20i%20think%20it's%20a%20glitch%20and%20i%20can't%20delete%20this%20with%20the%20forwd%20slash%20or%20all%20hell%20breaks%20loose%20so%20i%20leave%20this%20here%20ya%20know/.%22,%20%22creditlink%22=%3E%22https://www.them.us/story/john-walter-capsid/%22,%20%22caption%22=%3E%22A%20still%20from%20the%20John%20Walter%20movie,%20%5C%22A%20Virus%20Walks%20Into%20A%20Bar%5C%22.%22%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Astrology Feb 1-19</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/astrology/Help-Astrology.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Astrology Feb 1-19" /><published>2019-02-02T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/astrology/Help-Astrology</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/astrology/Help-Astrology.html">&lt;h5&gt;Ask for help. Offer help.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These next couple weeks will be increasingly high energy, and by mid-February everyone is going to be on one. You are in a new place, really feeling yourself, and ready to make something that means something to you, the real you, the dusted-off shoulders you. You might surprise yourself with how much you will be able to accomplish. At the same time, it can be easy to get frenzied. Stay grounded by giving your out-of-this-world grand plans connected a results-oriented project, practical daily routine or be in collaboration with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visualization for this: ride a wave of electric inspiration. If you start to think you know everything or try to do too much, you will wipe out, dude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal identity is super activated right now. You see it in the hideous red MAGA caps, but also in the prevalence of identity politics. It seems like asking for each other’s pronouns is becoming more mainstream. In the next couple of weeks, you’ll follow the urge to express and try new things from this newfound sense of self. It’s like getting a new bike and wanting to ride it everywhere you go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may feel like helping others, which can grow into an inspired sense of thinking you know what is right for everyone. As long as you keep it grounded, or, you know, maybe ask them what they want. The high ideals and wild-hair inspirations that hit like a flash of lightning are good when you are connected to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to ground yourself right now is to connect with other humans. Ask for help. Share how you feel. Ask how they feel. Find out how you can help. This year gives special blessings to those of pure heart doing altruistic creative projects for the better of all - sorry demon-spawn, it’s just not your year : (&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Working together in Oakland&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families, students and teachers in Oakland are coming together to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/education/school-crisis&quot;&gt;protect public schools.&lt;/a&gt; Their drive to get through to the school board is building steam and there will probably be a teacher’s strike this February. My friend, Rumi Koshino, is an artist and a teacher in Oakland. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com&quot;&gt;A few days ago, I asked her how she’s doing.&lt;/a&gt; Her response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s energizing and exhausting at the same time.” Rumi said,” We teach all day, and after we go to meetings about strikes and the school board meetings. It’s like going to night school. I’m learning all these new things, like how it works and how it’s totally messed up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 23, the OUSD board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kqed.org/news/11716967/oaklands-school-closure-plans-off-to-a-rough-start-for-some-parents&quot;&gt;voted to close ROOTS International Academy in East Oakland.&lt;/a&gt; Rumi said, “The students, families and teachers spoke at the OUSD board meeting. They are so good at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ousd.granicus.com/mediaplayer.php?clip_id=1401&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR0jkimaNOdAAqyba3GYzQrJYGgMIqnIqssfzu0IFFu_PHRmk42x231Lntg&quot;&gt;articulating what they want with the facts to back it up.&lt;/a&gt; I would hope to be able to speak with such heartfelt passion to really move people!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three days in January, &lt;a href=&quot;https://justseeds.org/art-build-techniques-for-protest/&quot;&gt;Art Build&lt;/a&gt; organized a &lt;a href=&quot;https://justseeds.org/oea-art-build-stand-with-oakland-teachers-and-students/&quot;&gt;community art-making event in which they made 600 picket signs, 1,000 patches, 5 parachute banners, 30-50 banners, numerous t-shirts, and 500-plus posters.&lt;/a&gt; Rumi said that “a band from one of the high schools played live jazz music while we worked. It was very festive. These are the things that keep me going!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/education/student-help&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/oakschool_promo_ad_gramps.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The year ahead&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now is a prime time to activate. The theme of 2019 is taking care of ourselves, taking care of others and letting others take care of us. We can be heard better than ever and we can listen better than ever. &lt;a href=&quot;https://justseeds.org/art-build-techniques-for-protest/&quot;&gt;This year is excellent for creative projects, like art, music and poetry that help other people, express an altruistic message or just are deep in the feels.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a good year to follow your dreams and do the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recipe for success = patient regular work time + heart is in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can sound like I’m saying this year will be all peace and love and hippy dippy easy breezy, but you know that making art when you’re tuned in to others can be super emotionally taxing. It’s like walking a tightrope while cuddling a fuzzy wuzzy baby bear [I did an analogy]. In this kind of astro weather, it can be easy to hide away, zone out, binge on media and just isolate. None of these things is wrong. I encourage the following of the heart, whatever that means to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a way to help out, here are some easy things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellaheartteachers.com&quot;&gt;Buy a T-shirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds go to OEA’s membership assistance fund which gives strike hardship grants to teachers who are actively participating in a strike. More than shirts have been purchased already. Printed at Movement Ink, a shop in Oakland’s Laurel District. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellaheartteachers.com&quot;&gt;They’re cute. They’re red. And you should get one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/keeppublicschoolsopen-gmail-com-keep-our-neighborhood-public-schools-open-f805c663-e4b0-49d6-8837-bc1863c4a0ee?recruiter=44321053&amp;amp;utm&quot;&gt;Sign the petition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents teachers students &amp;amp; community started this petition to show the OUSD board and Superintendent Dr. Kyla Johnson-Trammell that voters see what is happening and that we stand in solidarity with the students and their families. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/keeppublicschoolsopen-gmail-com-keep-our-neighborhood-public-schools-open-f805c663-e4b0-49d6-8837-bc1863c4a0ee?recruiter=44321053&amp;amp;utm&quot;&gt;The list is growing fast!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://donorbox.org/breadfored&quot;&gt;Give $10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://donorbox.org/breadfored&quot;&gt;Bread for Ed&lt;/a&gt; is a campaign to provide meals at solidarity schools, food trucks at picket lines. The vast majority of Oakland students depend on free or reduced lunches, so this food fund is a critical show of solidarity with the Oakland community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://donorbox.org/breadfored&quot;&gt;Give a delicious donation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For three years she has been teaching at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ousd.org/domain/1712&quot;&gt;Oakland High,&lt;/a&gt; where the teachers are probably going to strike this February. I called her a few nights ago and asked how she’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god. It’s crazy. Exhausting. It’s all messed up. I don’t know what’s going on. I’m hearing it’s not new. I’m learning all of this as a new-ish teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never known her to be this excited, and I have known Rumi for years - first as a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://vignettes.us/rumi-koshino-red-and-blue/&quot;&gt;her art,&lt;/a&gt; and later as a collaborator and friend. She is calm, caring, steady and buoyant; she doesn’t dramatize things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/dt_banner.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumi feels lucky to be at Oakland High. She works in a big, bright classroom with large windows. Oakland High is on a “block schedule”, which means she gets to teach three long classes each day instead of, say, five short classes. Her colleagues “are focused on equity and social justice” and she said, “It’s rare to have such a good relationship between staff and teachers. The principal is calm, grounded and available. He know’s what’s happening, he’s there for us. And the assistant principals work hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently living in San Francisco, Rumi has been on the west coast for over ten years, but she grew up in Japan, “where everyone was Japanese.” Rumi’s students are from every corner of the globe. She told me, “It’s such a privilege to have this diversity. My students are all kids of color. They come from Yemen, Central America, Guatemala, El Salvador, China, mixed races and Oakland kids who only know Oakland. I tell them, ‘You don’t even know how lucky you are! This is like the United Nations.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her students run the gamut of typical teenage demeanors: they are awkward, passionate, engaged, annoying, funny, active, heartbroken, in-love, sensitive, brilliant, curious, etc. Unlike kids at some other schools where Rumi previously worked, “students who were only 15-years-old had already learned to kiss the teacher’s ass for grades.” In comparison, she says, “Oakland kids, they’re so honest. They speak their mind and that allows me to be honest. To be myself.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumi is honest too: “If I didn’t like my school and my situation, I would teach in San Francisco and GET PAID.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oakland schools are experiencing a teacher retention crisis. The district is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/09/19/debt-ridden-oakland-unified-to-get-34-7-million-state-bailout/&quot;&gt;deeply in debt&lt;/a&gt; and teachers have been without a contract for the past year. In negotiation with the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), teachers are asking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smaller class sizes and lower Special Education case loads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More student support, like librarians, counselors, psychologists and restorative justice coordinators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A living wage (12% raise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how this can be paid for, Rumi said,“The OUSD admin give themselves a lot of money but then they say there is a budget crisis. They could solve the crisis if they cut their salaries. They spend a huge amount of money on consultancies. And a lot of the money goes to lawyers to cover their own backs. But teachers get lower than a living wage and can’t afford to live in Oakland. There is a teacher retention crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All January, Oakland teachers have been mobilizing. Rumi explained, “It’s energizing and exhausting at the same time. We teach all day, and after we go to meetings about strikes and the school board meetings. It’s like going to night school. I’m learning all these new things, like how it works and how it’s totally messed up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is “totally messed up” is the OUSD’s threat to close 1/3 of its non-charter public schools. Last summer, the OUSD board passed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oaklandpost.org/2018/11/30/oakland-unified-moves-forward-plan-close-24-schools/&quot;&gt;The Community of Schools Policy,&lt;/a&gt; which will close as many as 24 public schools in the next 5 years. Luckily, Rumi’s school, Oakland High, is not on that list. However, all of the schools slated to be closed are in East Oakland and West Oakland, serving poc and low-income communities. All schools located in the hills, that serve financially stable communities, and that have more white students, are safe from the shut-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charter school industry has been working on Oakland as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/education/school-crisis&quot;&gt;“portfolio district”&lt;/a&gt; for over 20 years. The OUSD Board has been collaborating with the charter school lobby. Starting with the poorest neighborhoods, they destabilize existing public schools, force school shut-downs and replace them with charter schools. The objective of the “portfolio district” blueprint is to privatize education by converting public schools into investment portfolio products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings Rumi has been going to have been a crash course in this fraught history; it’s like OUSD 101. She says, “It’s a lot! But we’re doing it for our work and our students. I see the school children coming together and speaking up for themselves: it’s energizing and empowering to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 23, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/01/28/roots-middle-school-to-close/&quot;&gt;the OUSD board voted to close ROOTS International Academy in East Oakland.&lt;/a&gt; Rumi said, “The students, parents and teachers spoke at the OUSD board meeting. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ousd.granicus.com/mediaplayer.php?clip_id=1401&quot;&gt;They are so good at articulating what they want with the facts to back it up.&lt;/a&gt; I would hope to be able to speak with such heartfelt passion to really move people!” However, the board sat stone-faced, showing no signs of interest or concern. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kqed.org/news/11716967/oaklands-school-closure-plans-off-to-a-rough-start-for-some-parents&quot;&gt;It is hard to keep going when the school board makes big decisions without showing any consideration for community input.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumi shifts between feeling inspired, resilient and at times defeated. She told me, “Negotiation. Communication. Those words! I feel like it’s not working. Who are the board getting money from? Our school board member, Aimee Eng, gave us the run around.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After the ROOTS vote it just felt hopeless. All the schools they close are in underserved neighborhoods. Like ROOTS is at International and 60th in East Oakland. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rootsinternationalacademy.com/we-know-where-we-come-from&quot;&gt;ROOTS is really thriving!&lt;/a&gt; Small schools like ROOTS are important to the neighborhood. Now kids have to walk 35 blocks to get to class. It’s very unsafe, a human trafficking hub. Kids are afraid to be on the street. All except one member on the OUSD board voted to close the school.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to not feel distracted by the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postnewsgroup.com/2019/01/22/parents-ask-whos-behind-roots-school-closure/&quot;&gt;apparent corruption&lt;/a&gt; behind the board’s baffling decisions. The OUSD administration and the charter school lobby have leveraged hard to peddle this idea that keeping schools open creates financial loss, when in fact enrollment funding is their prime source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year and a half, Rumi and her colleagues have been in the process of negotiating with the OUSD through their union rep. It is a process of voting, sending the vote to the district, waiting and voting again. Rumi just sent me an email saying, “Our strike vote will be counted tomorrow. I’ll let you know what the result will be as soon as I find out!” Tomorrow is Saturday, February 2, 2019. I will update this article when I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, 2/4/2019 UPDATE: I just received this from Rumi: “95 % of teachers voted YES to strike!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against all odds, students in California’s poorest neighborhoods shine brightly in public schools, but when lobby-controlled school boards close their schools, they are forced to fight for an education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be a story about these students, their teachers and families. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ousd.granicus.com/player/clip/1401?fbclid=IwAR0jkimaNOdAAqyba3GYzQrJYGgMIqnIqssfzu0IFFu_PHRmk42x231Lntg&quot;&gt;They are speaking out&lt;/a&gt; and doing everything they can to keep their schools open. But the students have no leverage: they don’t have a lot of money and they are not white. &lt;a href=&quot;https://edsource.org/2019/oakland-school-board-votes-to-close-first-of-up-to-two-dozen-schools-amid-opposition/607844?fbclid=IwAR1Qh3UT6rI245V4JHOvyjOGHhHuTe88Hxrsn4mH5nUBXc8_2xMD8hcX_tM&quot;&gt;So the school board ignores them.&lt;/a&gt; And regular citizens don’t hear the students either. They don’t feel the urgency, even though it’s their own hard-earned taxpayer money getting funneled into &lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondtradeoffs.economist.com/implementing-billion-dollar-mandate&quot;&gt;private investment portfolios.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rootsinternationalacademy.com/we-know-where-we-come-from&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/roots_pictures.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Students from ROOTS International Academy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could say, “Imagine it’s your kid that suddenly has to find a new school.” or “These kids are just like you were when you were in high school. They just want experiences, opportunities, relationships and a safe place to be teenagers.“ and then I’d say, “Remember when you were in high school?” and then you’d say, “I’d rather not.” Which is understandable. For those of us who had the privilege of school, it is was a dreaded delight to really just hate it to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oaklandpost.org/2018/12/27/school-district-wants-close-roots-international-academy-school-year/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/roots_field.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The ROOTS International Academy community.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this doesn’t really have anything to do with these students, as much as it cuts to admit this. Thanks to racism, classism and political shell games, this isn’t about the students, the awkward geniuses, who usually but not always bloom where they’re planted. It should be about them because they are the real protagonists, the heroes of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is a showdown between the charter school lobbyists and the teacher’s unions. The charter school lobby has been systematically taking over public schools in California for over two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works. In order to convert public schools into investment packages, the charter school industry targets a vulnerable region, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatlakescenter.org/docs/Policy\_Briefs/Saltman\_PortfolioDistricts.pdf&quot;&gt;a “portfolio district”,&lt;/a&gt; where they gain political influence over the school board. Starting with the poorest neighborhoods, they destabilize existing public schools, force school shut-downs, install charter schools and deliver financial returns to investors. That’s the basic blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The “portfolio district” blueprint being played out in Oakland&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oakland Unified School District board members receive massive campaign funds from both &lt;a href=&quot;https://edsource.org/2018/charter-school-supporters-and-critics-are-big-spenders-in-some-bay-area-school-board-elections/604403&quot;&gt;the teacher unions and the charter school lobby.&lt;/a&gt; Basically, the unions want teachers to get paid and the lobby wants to convert public schools into investment packages. The charters disproportionately target neighborhoods where students have to contend with living in high-stress, violent environments with everyday threats like child trafficking and homelessness.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oaklandpost.org/2018/11/30/oakland-unified-moves-forward-plan-close-24-schools/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/ousd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oaklandpost.org/2018/11/30/oakland-unified-moves-forward-plan-close-24-schools/&quot;&gt;On June 27th, 2018, the OUSD board passed “The Community of Schools Policy,”&lt;/a&gt; which will close as many as 24 public schools in the next 5 years. All closures affect East Oakland and West Oakland schools that serve poc and low-income communities, in the area known as the “flatlands”. All schools located in the hills, that serve financially stable communities and that have more white students are safe from the shut-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edsource.org/2019/oakland-school-board-votes-to-close-first-of-up-to-two-dozen-schools-amid-opposition/607844?fbclid=IwAR1Qh3UT6rI245V4JHOvyjOGHhHuTe88Hxrsn4mH5nUBXc8_2xMD8hcX_tM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/flatlands.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deciding factor in school closures seems to be the neighborhood’s lack of financial and political leverage. It has nothing to do with the quality of the school. Even good schools get shut down with no consideration for the school’s deeply ingrained, positive impact on the community. For example, this month (January 2019) the OUSD board voted to close ROOTS International Academy, a thriving school in East Oakland. The board was unmoved by &lt;a href=&quot;https://edsource.org/2019/oakland-school-board-votes-to-close-first-of-up-to-two-dozen-schools-amid-opposition/607844?fbclid=IwAR1Qh3UT6rI245V4JHOvyjOGHhHuTe88Hxrsn4mH5nUBXc8_2xMD8hcX_tM&quot;&gt;the outpouring of heartfelt support&lt;/a&gt; from family, teachers and students at the OUSD board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Direct accounting vs the runaround&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OUSD runs $30 million over budget. The reasons for this shortfall include loss of revenue to charter schools, mismanagement by the OUSD administration and borrowing hundreds of millions from the state that they struggle to pay back. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oaklandpost.org/2018/09/14/ousd-may-receive-millions-state-aid-money-comes-strings/&quot;&gt;The Alameda County Office of Education and the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) have swooped in many times,&lt;/a&gt; advising the OUSD to shut down more schools, lay off more teachers and take out state loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, research has shown that closing schools and laying off faculty loses money by cutting off the primary source of revenue, student enrollment funds. It is also well-documented that shutting down replacing public schools with charters almost always costs more. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/closures&quot;&gt;a recent UC Berkeley study&lt;/a&gt; states that is “a  high-risk/low-gain strategy that fails to hold promise with respect to either student achievement or non-cognitive well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers, parents and community advocates are asking for more practical steps to reaching solvency: their solutions all amount to more transparency. And right now is the time to make this happen. The California Legislature recently passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/09/19/debt-ridden-oakland-unified-to-get-34-7-million-state-bailout/&quot;&gt;Education Trailer Bill, which offers the OUSD district a grant of $34.7 million&lt;/a&gt; to be doled out over the next three years, but they can only receive this funding if they cut $30 million in their annual budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public school advocates want to balance the budget by going to the source of the problem, basic accounting. Proposed solutions include hiring a Chief Financial Officer to establish financial accountability, to shine a light on how funds are being mismanaged and to create a strategy to reduce expensive consultancies and bloated admin salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kqed.org/news/11716967/oaklands-school-closure-plans-off-to-a-rough-start-for-some-parents&quot;&gt;Parents were dumbfounded by the sudden push to close ROOTS International Academy.&lt;/a&gt; They found out via a robocall in December 2018 and less than a month later, the board voted to shut down their kids’ school. The OUSD continues to willfully lose student enrollment funds by closing schools, while making the claim that it is to “save money”. This sounds like gas lighting, the parasitic kryptonite that leeches off of earnest endeavors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postnewsgroup.com/2019/01/22/parents-ask-whos-behind-roots-school-closure/&quot;&gt;Parents just want to know what’s really going on.&lt;/a&gt; They want to know if the board and other public organizations are being influenced by the charter school lobby, including GO Pub­lic School, Educate78, New Schools Venture Fund and the California Charter School As­sociation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The difference between individual charter schools and the charter school industry&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter schools have devoted supporters. And every charter school is unique. I used to work at two excellent charter schools in the Bay Area. Many students, teachers and parents have found charters to provide a unique home for academic success. Parents who are frustrated with public schools should have the option to move their kids to a school that offers what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like regular public schools, charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive public funds based on enrollment and attendance. The only difference is in the charter, or contract, that spells out the way they operate based on a unique vision and alternative approach to educational success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the financial industry found a way to prey on this unique arrangement. The private charter industry pays off school board members in their hunt for student enrollment money. When this happens, the school board board no longer acts as an impartial servant for student academic success. The board becomes a puppet for a strategic takeover by increasing school closures without consideration for its traumatizing impact on underserved and poc children. The objective of the “district portfolio” blueprint is to privatize education by converting all public schools into investment portfolio products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.financial-planning.com/list/aibnb-charter-schools-unusual-real-estate-strategies&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.queerauntie.com/assets/img/cash.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charter school lobby argues that public schools have gotten complacent and don’t provide a good education. Their thinking supports privatization of public services in general: open market competition “naturally” breeds excellence and provides consumers with more options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher’s unions claim that the effects of charter school industry strategies, such as destabilizing existing public schools and selectively recruiting high performing students, are a drain on enrollment dollars and this financial blow drastically cuts into resources for underserved and poc public school students. The teacher’s unions want a moratorium on the creation of new charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;A temporary moratorium on the &quot;portfolio district&quot; blueprint in Los Angeles&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, on January 29, &lt;a href=&quot;https://laist.com/2019/01/29/lausd_board_asks_state_to_temporarily_halt_new_charter_schools_from_opening.php&quot;&gt;the LAUSD board declared a temporary hiatus on the formation of new charter schools&lt;/a&gt; in order to take a step back and analyze charter school impact. A comprehensive study by the California Department of Education is expected to be published late 2019 and will examine the more than two decades of charter school growth in California, the state with the most charter schools in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edsource.org/2019/la-unified-teachers-still-face-challenges-over-contract-and-charter-school-moratorium/607910&quot;&gt;The LAUSD board doesn’t actually have the power to suspend new charter schools;&lt;/a&gt; this is something the California Legislature would likely have to approve. The LAUSD board’s action is more of a “please help us” signal to Sacramento, where a statewide cap on charter schools has been talked about. The OUSD board piggy-backed on to the LAUSD’s plea, letting Sacramento know that they want to be included in a statewide cap, if it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newly elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tony Thurmond, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/11/01/california-superintendent-of-public-instruction-charter-schools/&quot;&gt;has promised a pause on charter school expansion.&lt;/a&gt; Governor Gavin Newsom is more vague, supporting investigations into conflicts of interest and more transparency in the charter school industry, however he hasn’t spoken out about a moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the OUSD board, most of the LAUSD board members have received large payments from the charter lobby, so this “temporary moratorium” on new charters may be a way to appear temporarily unbiased. The charter school lobby has proven to be excellent at their long game, finding ways to diffuse any obvious correlation between the lobby’s campaign donations and pro-charter bias on school boards across California.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Regina Clarkinia</name></author><category term="California" /><category term="Education" /><category term="Kids" /><category term="poc" /><summary type="html">The basic blueprint</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22crunching_numbers.jpg%22,%20%22teaser%22=%3Enil%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Uranus Enters Taurus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/astrology/Uranus-Enters-Taurus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Uranus Enters Taurus" /><published>2018-05-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-05-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/astrology/Uranus-Enters-Taurus</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/astrology/Uranus-Enters-Taurus.html">&lt;p&gt;Uranus moves through signs very slowly, in each sign for like 7 or more years… so I like to see how this unfolds. Even though the fateful day of the transition is meaningful and it’s funny you actually can notice the switch, I like to wait and see what we foment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a metaphor: planet transiting through a sign like making sauerkraut. At the beginning of a transit it’s like when you first put cabbage and salt covered up - no real change yet. It’s a big change in the sense that cabbage that was once whole is now chopped into a thousand tiny pieces, but there’s no fermentation developing yet. Day one, two, three, four… try not to peek because not much has changed. One week in, not ready to eat but change, yes, Taste, you can feel where it’s going with this but it hasn’t peaked. Whats in the air makes a difference in the flavor. Then 2 weeks or more in is a good time, yes, we see what has developed and how this particular transit has affected things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For contrast to Uranus in each sign for 7 years, the moon is perhaps the fastest mover of the “planets”… in each sign for like two and a half days. You can really feel that change since it starts-&amp;gt;middle-&amp;gt;ends so quickly, and it strikes at the gut and emotions. Quick pickle… or scratch that: fast fermentation. The moon is subconscious, vibesy, feelings, moods, hidden or invisible tendrils… to define as examples of how you can perceive moon stuff, just for the sake of noticing in our world, in others and self how the Moon dyes daily life things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another comparison, the Sun is in each sign for a month. It’s very conscious, logical and the ways we openly express. and conspicuously espouse ideas and actions. Like when people say, “I’ve been very busy on lots of projects. My calendar is very full.” What they brag and/or humble-brag about is where you see the Sun doing it’s magic. You can also see the sun’s influence in holidays - open celebrations that the whole culture gets behind. Or like bumper sticker saying it plain: My Kid is an Honor Roll Student. Whereas with the moon - they’ll express through a mood. If you want to catch their drift, you have to pick up on facial expressions, subtle glances, thickness and quality of the air, a lilt of their walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Uranus - it’s electrified, weird, unemotional and altruistic, with a bee in the bonnet to erect new-fangled public works projects to bring everyone into the future, more equality, integrity… like a shot in the arm. I always think of the mad scientist from Back to the Future. In Taurus, the first thing I think is prolific growth, sprouting new weird creative social projects, totally new ways of valuing work, new architecture for the financial system, innovations on farming and feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranus is currently opposite Jupiter which is like limited bleak outlook, and combative resentful bucking at this. (the way to have backbone in this scenario is hope. It’s a choice, to some degree - whats in the air affects the fermentation.) But in 7 years by the time Uranus is ready to complete the time in Taurus, Jupiter will have just uplifted and filled Uranus in Taurus with it’s big fatty luck charms. Whatever we’ve built will get bigger - greed or hope or equality or whatever we want to make. Also in 7 years, Saturn will be in Pisces and Neptune will be in Aries… all of which points to renovation and new chances for how society, the masses, large groups interact, feedback, connect and bounce off each other to weave our oceanic constellation fabric. We have a lot of say on how this turns out. Uranus in Taurus for 7 or something years… what will that ferment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranus has been in Aries for 7 years. What did we get from that? Maybe all these new civil rights and more mainstream awareness of terrorism against poc, queer, women, etc… since Aries is a combative avenger that hates lies and instinctively kicks towards what feels true for family/brothers/sisters/lovers. I don’t know. Whatever it is, we will make it and it will be ours. Do you have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Regina Clarkinia</name></author><category term="Uranus" /><category term="Transits" /><category term="Astrology" /><summary type="html">Uranus moves through signs very slowly, in each sign for like 7 or more years… so I like to see how this unfolds.
