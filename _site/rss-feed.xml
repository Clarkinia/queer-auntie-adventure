				<title>New-ish</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rumikoshino.com/section/203890-Sculpture-Installation.html&quot;&gt;Rumi Koshino&lt;/a&gt; is an artist and teacher. For three years she has been teaching at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ousd.org/domain/1712&quot;&gt;Oakland High,&lt;/a&gt; where the teachers are probably going to strike this February. I called her a few nights ago and asked how she’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Uranus Enters Taurus</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Uranus moves through signs very slowly, in each sign for like 7 or more years… so I like to see how this unfolds. Even though the fateful day of the transition is meaningful and it’s funny you actually can notice the switch, I like to wait and see what we foment.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Museum at F.I.T.</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Late April. Around 5:30pm. I’m walking down the street to a see a museum show about high fashion for different body types. Right out in public, in the middle of busy Manhattan, a class of bootcampers side-shuffle from one side of the one-lane street to the other. At any moment, a car could drive through them, or want to drive through them. The instructor shouts commands in a heavy New York accent. I imagined he had been a fire fighter or a cop who survived 9-11 and couldn’t work the job anymore due to PTSD. He decided on a career change: to use his aggressive tenacity to motivate 20-somethings into shape.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sugar Hill Museum</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The Sugar Hill Museum, in the Sugar Hill neighborhood of Harlem, is full of interactive materials. Raw wood sticks with frayed bark in a horizontal built-in shelf, some just lying there, others in a natural fiber basket. They seem like props for kids to generate stories and I wondered how it worked. Same with the living room-sized chess board on the floor with toddler-sized chess pieces in the central open gallery space. Keeping track of any chess game would result in a story structure, since it has relationship, motivation, strategy to pull that off with devastating losses and smug victories, and every emotion in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Town Cats</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Town Cats who &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to own the turf.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s a jukebox of kittens.&lt;br /&gt;
They pee on the mats. Perfume!&lt;br /&gt;
Now that’s the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;
They &lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt; to fight the House Cat.&lt;br /&gt;
The big owner invades!&lt;br /&gt;
They pee and have sex. Feline Infection!&lt;br /&gt;
They &lt;strong&gt;realize&lt;/strong&gt; they don’t mind the cars, that much anyways.&lt;br /&gt;
If they &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; only &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; Tommy to &lt;strong&gt;stop trying&lt;/strong&gt; an insurrection.&lt;br /&gt;
Bass drum. High hat. Scratch. Crash! Ride.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>When It’s Just Dark</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Sheets of hot tin roof go “waeahwaehhhweeaahhh,” a shimmering saw. Fleet-footed. A piece of cake pulled from the one cooling in the windah. Crumblings onto the unlit grass shards. Running through backyards in just the 1950s just a boy with a slingshot in yer pocket sayin’ “gee whiz” the neck snaps back, trachea bent into a dent by a cotton cord not always strung with clothes usually but not always. His birthright chances scatter like cat-eyes, surround where his spine lies. Their glassy flecks currying God-given favors, oven lives, clotheslines, boy oh boy cake freaks.&lt;/p&gt;
