**Reg Clarkinia** is an artist, comedian and writer based in Los Angeles. They have performed in popular weekly comedy shows around LA and have exhibited funny videos and performed live at art galleries, including Krowswork and Sweeney Kaye in Oakland, CA.

Reg’s approach to children’s entertainment combines fantasy with realism and family-friendly, irreverent, kid-led storytelling. They have taught kids to make their own video games, zines and audio/video productions, including a musical history of the Black Panthers.

They worked professionally as a photographer and videographer on educational web content, and have made indie videos, including a microbudget [children’s show](https://vimeo.com/24359577) that exhibited at Martina-Johnston Gallery in Berkeley, CA.

Reg reads tarot cards and [astrology charts](https://www.clarkiniaastrology.com/). They write about mysticism and teach practical meditation techniques.

This blog is an anarchic adventure through wormholes, bookstores, libraries, museums, the internet, programming, gaming, education and fashion.
