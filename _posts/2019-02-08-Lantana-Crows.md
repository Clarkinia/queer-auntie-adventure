The air gets crisp with melted grass <br>
on quiet, hot days in Southern California. <br>
The sidewalk makes its move to dehydrate <br>
back to cement powder. <br>

Crows and Lantana <br>
glide their skeletons at the sun. <br>
Dashboard covers hardly shield the heat. <br>
Even the basement is hot with the sun. <br>

Lantana glows easily <br>
towards it, <br>
as if the sun were a <br>
cool, moss-edged pool. <br>

Crows glare back at the glare <br>
to measure the cat's eye <br>
against other marbles, <br>
buttons and round shiny things. <br>

The crow collects, sorts <br>
and radiates it onto the lawn, <br>
like a grandparent's knitting pattern. <br>

You don't have to look at it. <br>
Your arms dangle like hot seatbelts. <br>
Your skin wrinkles more rapidly. <br>

Skeins on the lawn <br>
connecting one corner <br>
of skin to the other. <br>

Cool sheets over hot skin, <br>
cover old furniture. <br>

The sidewalk is cracked where <br>
a tree used to stand. <br>

You wouldn't know it if you hadn't seen it. <br>
