<h5>Pack your bag</h5>
**Seat belt** that will keep you in place when electric storms rattle the chassis

**Lube and protection** so you have no regrets after life-affirming sex with alien creatures

**Energy bars and energy drinks** to keep you fueled during marathon star fleet escapades

**Symbolic patch, jewelry or tattoo** that represents your true self and what you stand for

**Walkie-talkie** to be ready to help your crew, ask them to help you or just ramble about idiotic manifestos

**Notepad** to take notes when alien counterparts are talking to you about their weirdo ways of doing things

**Book of poetry** that translates the mist and dust into words that help you get how plankton feel

**A soft, cushy pillow, blanket and pajamas** because you may not know this, but you actually need to sleep

**Magical liniment** given to you by your panther mother to help you stalk the life goals that make you feel good

- deep tissue massage with something extra, like hot stones

- ice-skating triple salchow

- really fucked up scary stories around a bonfire with friends

- learn a new song in your bedroom with only the flashlight on

- ask your worst self how they are doing and take them on a day trip

- scream in the bathtub, moan in the bathtub

- line dancing, ballroom dancing, learning dance moves with another person

- climb to the top of a mountain and then look out and be like, "wow"

- fly in a plane or helicopter
