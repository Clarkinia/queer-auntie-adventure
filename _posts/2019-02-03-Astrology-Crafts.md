<h5>Sci-Fi Planetary Escapades: Astro Activities Feb 1-19</h5>


<h5>Pack your bag</h5>
**Seat belt** that will keep you in place when electric storms rattle the chassis

**Lube and protection** so you have no regrets after life-affirming sex with alien creatures

**Energy bars and energy drinks** to keep you fueled during marathon star fleet escapades

**Symbolic patch, jewelry or tattoo** that represents your true self and what you stand for

**Walkie-talkie** to be ready to help your crew, ask them to help you or just ramble about idiotic manifestos

**Notepad** to take notes when alien counterparts are talking to you about their weirdo ways of doing things

**Book of poetry** that translates the mist and dust into words that help you get how plankton feel

**A soft, cushy pillow, blanket and pajamas** because you may not know this, but you actually need to sleep

**Magical liniment** given to you by your panther mother to help you stalk the life goals that make you feel good

<h5>Alien adventures</h5>
brochures in seedy hotel lobby: pick one

- team sports, get out your aggression and pass the ball

- get outfitted in red satin or silk then go roller skating

- deep tissue massage with something extra, like hot stones

- ice-skating triple salchow

- really fucked up scary stories around a bonfire with friends

- learn a new song in your bedroom with only the flashlight on

- ask your worst self how they are doing and take them on a day trip

- scream in the bathtub, moan in the bathtub

- line dancing, ballroom dancing, learning dance moves with another person

- climb to the top of a mountain and then look out and be like, "wow"

- fly in a plane or helicopter

<h5>The tattoo</h5>
supplies: paper and pen

1. what is one way in which you are both mis-understood and ahead of your time? (awaken, teen angst)


2. you hold the key to how things could be more fair for everyone. write it down in a 3-word manifesto.


3. draw your personal ID symbol based on your 3-word manifesto.


4. with ball-point pen, draw your symbol on your arm.


5. this weekend, scavenge for one other person’s manifesto, but don’t ask them outright. see if you can glean it. listen to their way, what is special about them, what makes them tick, their foods, customs and the way they show thanks. listen closely and with deeper sensitivity than ever. listen so close that you could play a drum solo of their heart and breath. be a guest at their table. notice how they do things in a way you would have never considered. draw and write your findings.
