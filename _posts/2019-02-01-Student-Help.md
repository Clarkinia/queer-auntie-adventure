If you are looking for a way to help out, here are some easy things you can do:

<h5><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hellaheartteachers/">Buy a T-shirt</a></h5>
  Proceeds go to OEA's membership assistance fund which gives strike hardship grants to teachers who are actively participating in a strike. 500+ shirts have been purchased already. Printed at Movement Ink, a shop in Oakland's Laurel District. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hellaheartteachers/">They're cute. They're red. And you should get one.</a>

  Parents teachers students & community started this petition to show the OUSD board and Superintendent Dr. Kyla Johnson-Trammell that voters see what is happening and that we stand in solidarity with the students and their families.

  Bread for Ed</a> is a campaign to provide meals at solidarity schools, food trucks at picket lines.
