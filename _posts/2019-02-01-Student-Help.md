<a href="https://www.queerauntie.com/education/rumi">Teachers, families and students are fighting for public school education in Oakland, CA.</a>

If you are looking for a way to help out, here are some easy things you can do:

<h5><a href="https://www.hellaheartteachers.com">Buy a T-shirt</a></h5>
  Proceeds go to OEA's membership assistance fund which gives strike hardship grants to teachers who are actively participating in a strike. More than shirts have been purchased already. Printed at Movement Ink, a shop in Oakland's Laurel District. <a href="https://www.hellaheartteachers.com">They're cute. They're red. And you should get one.</a>

  Parents teachers students & community started this petition to show the OUSD board and Superintendent Dr. Kyla Johnson-Trammell that voters see what is happening and that we stand in solidarity with the students and their families. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/keeppublicschoolsopen-gmail-com-keep-our-neighborhood-public-schools-open-f805c663-e4b0-49d6-8837-bc1863c4a0ee?recruiter=44321053&utm">The list is growing fast!</a>

<h5><a href="https://donorbox.org/breadfored">Give $10</a></h5>
  <a href="https://donorbox.org/breadfored">Bread for Ed</a> is a campaign to provide meals at solidarity schools, food trucks at picket lines. The vast majority of Oakland students depend on free or reduced lunches, so this food fund is a critical show of solidarity with the Oakland community. <a href="https://donorbox.org/breadfored">Give a delicious donation.</a>
