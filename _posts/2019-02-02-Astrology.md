Sci-Fi Planetary Escapades: Horoscope for Feb 1-19, 2019 (through Valentines Day)

<h5>Pack your bag</h5>
Seat belt that will keep you in place when electric storms rattles the chassis

Lube and protection so you have no regrets after life-affirming sex with alien creatures

Energy bars and energy drinks to keep you fueled during star fleet escapades

Your symbolic patch, jewelry or tattoo that represents your true self and what you stand for

Walkie-talkie to be ready to help your crew, ask them to help you or just ramble about idiotic manifestos

Notepad to take notes when alien counterparts are talking to you about their weirdo ways of doing things

Book of poetry that translates the mist and dust into words that help you get how plankton feel

A soft, cushy pillow, blanket and pajamas

Magical liniment given to you by your panther mother to help you stalk your life goals that make you feel good



<h5>alien adventures</h5>
brochures in seedy hotel lobby: pick one

team sports, get out your aggression and pass the ball
ally-oop rather than slam dunk
get outfitted in red satin or silk then go roller skating
deep tissue massage with something extra like hot rocks
candle-lit sex with lots of eye contact
ice-skating triple salchow
scary stories around a bonfire that really make you worried about life
learn a new song in your bedroom with only the flashlight on
ask your worst self how they are doing and take them on a day trip
get in the boxing ring with another boxer
scream in the bathtub
line dancing, ballroom dancing, learning dance moves with another person
climb to the top of a mountain and then look out and be like, "wow"
fly in a plane and look at all the little houses, backyards and cute people



<h5>the tattoo</h5>
supplies: paper and pen

1. what is one way in which you are both mis-understood and ahead of your time?


2. you hold the key to how things could be more fair for everyone. write it down in a 3-word manifesto.


3. draw your personal ID symbol based on your 3-word manifesto.


4. with ball-point pen, draw your symbol on your arm.


5. this weekend, scavenge for one other person’s manifesto, but don’t ask them outright. see if you can glean it. listen to their way, what is special about them, what makes them tick, their foods, customs and the way they show thanks. write it down. listen closely and with deeper sensitivity than ever. listen so close that you could play a drum solo of their heart and breath. be a guest at their table. notice how they do things in a way you would have never considered. draw and write your findings.
