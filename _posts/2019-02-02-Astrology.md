Forward motion - direct action
True to yourself and what you believe in and who you’re aligned with
Take turns: How to give and receive. How to ask for help and how to offer help.
Say your peace and then listen, take notes and learn how the other half lives
new to you: learning from other cultures, love relationships and listening to other people
higher ideals that invite everyone along

the theme of this year is going to have a lot to do with taking care of ourselves, letting others take care of us and taking care of others. it’s going to revolve around the way taxes work (supply-side or people-side), about the way we listen to each other, the way we treat people from other cultures.

radiating an air of knowing what separates you from the herd
the feeling of a job well-done, feeling the need to do things your own way
knowing what’s best for everyone
new ideas for how to implement service for others
inspired, revolutionary, activist

panther vibe of stalking your prey (life goals) and really targeting with laser eyes what makes you feel good, feel accomplished, satisfied, pleasure, content, fulfilled
it’s important to go for your goals, and to acknowledge what means alot to you and how you define success
ambition for a position of power and influence that is true to your core self and helps the people you care about
pay attention to bottled up anger, destructive rage from when you have been hurt or when you didn’t get your way, or what you wish was already true for you
take stock of who has the upper hand, who is below you, who is on your team, who can help you, who you can help, what you still need help on
intense desire to control situations: notice what you can do on your own and what you need help with, what you need cooperation, support with
fresh new identity and purpose that is more inclusive and honest, that frees up more honest relationships and true self

if someone is suffering, it’s everyone’s problem, it’s on the entire community to sit with them through it, to listen to what they need
for example, homeless people or victims of sexual violence or low-income schoolchildren or people with long-term illness - often these people are seen as beyond repair, not part of the rest of us or not worth our energy because they have so many issues, they are beyond repair, a time and money pit, where if you’re fortunate to be white, wealthy, straight male college-educated etc that you shouldn’t spend your energy there - not true! everyone’s pain is for everyone to care about - i wonder if this is true - i feel that it is but i don’t think a therapist would agree - this would be seen as a malady to think this way

all year long you can make a difference:
success for artistic work that helps others, music, visual art, poetry, broadcasting, sound - anything to help everyone come together to heal and include anyone who has been left behind
recipe for the impossible to get done = patient regular work time + heart is in the right place
discipline + compassion
rehearsals for a group art project, weekly band practice, theater project
monthly meetings for a charity organization
rock gardens, sand painting, rock climbing
deepen spiritual practice, working with others to help a cause, to help children, animals or anyone who needs help (including you)
pursue your dreams and higher values in a sensible, long-term approach
patient long-term disciplined work and sacrifice to pursuing dreams that are in line with your higher values and spiritual beliefs




How are we cared for how do we care about others - include Gregory’s dance class
How to give and receive
How to truly be of service, how to give help, get help, how to really be there for others, how to weave together,


being true to you - truer than ever - to yourself and your higher values, while also listening to others, seeing the world through their eyes, learning through experiencing others cultures. you don’t have to accept arbitrary old boxes, male or female, married or unmarried, but in this place of being truer to your real identity and self, can have to listen better than ever.
your identity and your higher values mean nothing if you allow your identity to isolate you or your higher values lead you to feel exceptional.
give structure and integrity to what is unique about you and what you stand for, that allows for an in and out flow of love
listen, integrate in relationship to others is the way to manifest your identity and higher values into something before you are a goner.

new world order trying to form a more reliable system that involves more specific definitions, communication and where to sacrifice, carry out responsibilities, how to lead and how to follow, when to listen and when to take the reigns
ain’t nothing nice
taking responsibility & knowing what’s best
doing the right thing (but everyone has different ideas of what right is)
learning how the other half lives
do unto others
new to you
higher ideals that invite everyone along
how to serve the community
groups and sacrifice for the better of all, but who is in the circle of friends, the family or the state: either you’re in or your’e out

can i recommend for this weekend
team sports: somewhere you can get out your aggression and pass the ball
ally-oop rather than slam dunk
deep tissue massage
candle-lit sex, with lots of eye contact
ice-skating triple salchow, dance, sing, play music with other people around a bonfire, learn a new song in your bedroom with candles
wear red satin or silk
boxing, martial arts, self defense class
kundalini yoga
scream
line dancing, ballroom dancing, learning dance moves with another person
brotherhood, doing for others, sacrificing for the family
hike to the top of a mountain and look out at how far we’ve come
fly in a plane and look at all the little houses, backyards and cute people
young, innocent, pure desire and ardent passion burning into boundless action
take notes, listen, notice, receive information and take notes

the tattoo
what is one way in which you are mis-understood and ahead of your time?

you hold the key to how things could be more fair for everyone. write it down in a 3-word manifesto.

draw your personal ID symbol based on your 3-word manifesto.

with ball-point pen, draw your symbol on your arm.

this weekend, scavenge for one other person’s manifesto, but don’t ask them outright. see if you can glean it. listen to their way, what is special about them, what makes them tick, their foods, customs and the way they show thanks. write it down.

who do you admire for the way they help others? write down one thing they do that you love. mirror their behavior one time this weekend in the smallest way possible.

what do you need help with? ask for help.

how can you help out others?




now go out there and listen to other people’s manifestos! pay attention to how other people live!

listen closely and with deeper sensitivity than ever. listen so close that you could play a drum solo of their heart and breath. be a guest at their table. notice how they do things in a way you would have never considered.

how can you act from your raw impulse while also listening to your partner

how can you take responsibility for yourself better.
how can you let someone else care for you better.

when i do my nodes email, i need to include gregory’s class






  sun is detached this week, above it all, armchair philosopher, self-righteous and thinking they know a superior way of being, living in a flawless, correct, advanced, at worst elitist, at best, altruistic and re-designing to better serve all of humanity - sense of knowing what is the right way, father knows best, knowing what’s best for everyone - enlightened social responsibility, exceptionalism - marching to a different drummer in a way that feels elitist, not going with the flow, not mirroring others - I liked that band before they were famous - group identity yet isolationist, the rare air of an exclusive group, concerned with higher ideals, social services, humanitarian, altruistic - how to have mental integrity while also intuitive, compassionate and emotionally receptive - applying higher wisdom altruism to construct architecture to deliver services (clean water) to the masses - coming up with a good idea that delivers social services to everyone (even if they are rather crude and mundane) - how to notice what is needed with a laser eye while also feeling soft receptivity      moon is interested in results, reality, earthing, the feel of money, fabrics, textures and machines that work well, the satisfaction of things working well, of making money, enterprise, weaving, a working loom, feeling good getting things done and wearing the finest garb, taking responsibility, the satisfaction of a job done right, taking a job so the rest of the family can pursue their dreams, someone has to do it     merc is detached and looking for higher future knowledge based purely on very specific truth that’s more theoretical than true like the movie TRON, delivering messages from another planet, weird, unique, off the wall and oddball, but taking weird shit too seriously, exploring totally new ways to serve, deliver the goods to everyone equally - researching, analyzing and taking in how people are living and how services are being delivered - a really good time to analyze, to travel and take notes, to observe and take note, to research, to redesign a better system with a totally new approach     mars is aggressive, active, reactive and has a lot of energy, motivated to act on what you instinctively know, acting on impulse, not having to know why, just do it, yell now ask questions later, tantrum now ask questions later, knee-jerk, going with your gut, taking a first step, acting on impulse to create yang energy that sweeps out negativity and heavy cobwebs, pressure releasing after building up for years, lava forging new land, doing a lot all at once, hair up your ass - questioning all rules - isn’t going to follow rules and laws just because, getting to the root of why we do things and burning laws that feel arbitrary - doing what I want and what feels right versus old laws that aren’t fair (or don’t seem fair) - needing to act now - do sports! protest! self-awareness and need to enact plans, carry out role, do your part - Aries symbolizes the finding of the True Self, a return to Innocence and right-action taken with no thought of reward. Forward motion, doubled up with uranus in aries - always onward never backward. eagerness to begin, eagerness to take it to the hoop, next level - identity versus the rules of engagement, knowing in your core who you are versus arbitrary ways society enforces a hegemonic system even issuing an ID card that may not make sense to who you actually are     venus is evaluating ways you explore and create new understanding through getting to know how other people see the world, stepping into the shoes of another, the shoe is on the other foot, integrating new cultures, perspectives that provide a totally fresh new advanced and more compassionate way of living, incorporating new, the aesthetics of new weird different out there ways of doing things, cross-pollinating, bringing together different cultures, sleeping with a foreigner, marrying a different country to create peace and expand economics and more bounty to share for all - and with the trine to uranus she is wanting to bring this new weird way of more altruistic action into the world on a larger and more aggressive scale - omg i can’t wait i really hope the queers, pocs and non-binaries win this one out in a zillion years next time uranus is back in aries     jupiter is expanding into new ways of seeing things by exploring completely new places, relationships and reaching in and moving into a new town for the year and taking on a totally new identity and relationship to learn more about learning, spirituality and ways of understanding- learning about other people to create a deeper understanding of the world     saturn is examining how to be more practical and find stability in crisis, how to build a lasting system for parenting the world, creating limitations that bring us closer through crisis, but also systems that withstand or prevent the crises we have been suffering with pluto, saturn loves how pluto is making its job easier in a way, creating the obstacles and reality checks, so saturn does less shaking things up and more making the limitations to design a more sturdy system       pluto is reaching deeper bonds through crisis regarding how responsibility to each other and how that plays out in enterprise, parenting and realistic system that make society go - aggressively shaking things up to really question why are things the way they are          neptune is creating dreamy soft pockets like clouds of love for us to trust, connect and see the bigger picture for why we are here - a really good time to truly manifest higher values - how do we put compassionate higher vibes into real action, manifestation        uranus is doing its victory lap on this new beginning that has been established over the last 7 or so years in aries, the aggressive powering through into a radical new design, the venus trine is making it about relationships, tone, design, rhythm and finding a way to bring some connectivity and sweetness to the weird new message, aesthetics of individual quirks
