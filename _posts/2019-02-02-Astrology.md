<h5>Sci-Fi Planetary Escapades:</h5>

These next couple weeks will be increasingly high energy. You might surprise yourself at how much you will be able to accomplish. At the same time, it can be easy to get frenzied. It can help to have your out-of-this-world grand plans connected to a results-oriented project, practical daily routine or in collaboration with others.

A visualization for this: ride a wave of electric inspiration. If you start to think you know everything or try to do too much, you will wipe out, dude.

Personal identity is super activated right now. You see it in the hideous red MAGA caps, but also in how identity politics have more prevalence and it seems like asking for each other’s pronouns is becoming more mainstream. In particular in the next couple of weeks, you'll follow the urge to express and try new things from this newfound sense of self: it just feels right.

You may feel like helping others, which can grow into an inspired sense of thinking you know what is right for others. That's ok too as long as you keep it grounded, or, you know, maybe ask them what they want. The high ideals and wild-hair inspirations that hit like a flash of lightning are good as long as you stay connected to reality.

The theme of this year is going to have a lot to do with taking care of ourselves, letting others take care of us and taking care of others. We can be heard better than ever and we can listen better than ever. This year is excellent for creative projects, like art, music and poetry that helps other people, expresses an altruistic message or just is deep in feels. The recipe for the impossible to get done = patient regular work time + heart is in the right place.

I know it sounds all peace and love and hippy dippy easy breezy, but this kind of raw weird art-making or close collaboration and higher values can be super emotionally taxing. It's like walking a tightrope while cuddling a fuzzy wuzzy baby bear. In this kind of astro weather, it can be easy to hide away, take a pre-fab job, binge on media and just isolate. I encourage the following of the heart, whatever that means to you.


<h5>For astro nerds</h5>
The standout this month are Aquarius and its ruling planet, Uranus. Both the Sun and Mercury are in Aquarius through mid-February. Uranus is doing its victory lap in Aries before <a href="https://www.queerauntie.com/astrology/uranus-enters-taurus">going back into Taurus</a> in March. Uranus has been firing up this new sense of identity over the last eight-ish years in Aries, aggressively powering through into a radical new design. We have lots of fun aspects to Uranus coming up in the next couple weeks. The Venus trine is making it about relationships, tone, design, rhythm and finding a way to bring some connectivity and sweetness to the freakazoid new individual flare.

Along with Uranus, Mars is also finishing its (much shorter) run in Aries. Mars kicked off the month with a square to Pluto and will be conjunct Mars on Feb 13, which promises to be off the hook weirdo energy, cumming like a pinball machine on another planet flashing TILT and like smoke is everywhere. At any rate, it should be a good day for online porn.

<h5>The tattoo</h5>
supplies: paper and pen

1. what is one way in which you are both mis-understood and ahead of your time? (awaken, teen angst)


2. you hold the key to how things could be more fair for everyone. write it down in a 3-word manifesto.


3. draw your personal ID symbol based on your 3-word manifesto.


4. with ball-point pen, draw your symbol on your arm.


5. this weekend, scavenge for one other person’s manifesto, but don’t ask them outright. see if you can glean it. listen to their way, what is special about them, what makes them tick, their foods, customs and the way they show thanks. listen closely and with deeper sensitivity than ever. listen so close that you could play a drum solo of their heart and breath. be a guest at their table. notice how they do things in a way you would have never considered. draw and write your findings.
