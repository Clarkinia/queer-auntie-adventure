<h5>Ask for help. Offer help.</h5>

These next couple weeks will be increasingly high energy. You might surprise yourself at how much you will be able to accomplish. At the same time, it can be easy to get frenzied. It can help to have your out-of-this-world grand plans connected to a results-oriented project, practical daily routine or be in collaboration with others.

A visualization for this: ride a wave of electric inspiration. If you start to think you know everything or try to do too much, you will wipe out, dude.

Personal identity is super activated right now. You see it in the hideous red MAGA caps, but also in how identity politics have more prevalence and it seems like asking for each otherâ€™s pronouns is becoming more mainstream. In the next couple of weeks, you'll follow the urge to express and try new things from this newfound sense of self. It's like getting a new bike and wanting to ride it everywhere you go!

You may feel like helping others, which can grow into an inspired sense of thinking you know what is right for everyone. As long as you keep it grounded, or, you know, maybe ask them what they want. The high ideals and wild-hair inspirations that hit like a flash of lightning are good when you are connected to reality.

The theme of this year is going to have a lot to do with taking care of ourselves, taking care of others and letting others take care of us. We can be heard better than ever and we can listen better than ever. This year is excellent for creative projects, like art, music and poetry that help other people, express an altruistic message or just are deep in the feels. It's a good time to follow your dreams and do the impossible. The recipe for success = patient regular work time + heart is in the right place.

It can sound like I'm saying this year will be all peace and love and hippy dippy easy breezy, but you know that making art when you're tuned in to others can be super emotionally taxing. It's like walking a tightrope while cuddling a fuzzy wuzzy baby bear. In this kind of astro weather, it can be easy to hide away, take a pre-fab job, binge on media and just isolate. None of these things is wrong. I encourage the following of the heart, whatever that means to you.
