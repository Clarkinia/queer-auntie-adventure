Town Cats who **want** to own the turf.  
It’s a jukebox of kittens.  
They pee on the mats. Perfume!  
Now that’s the ticket.  
They **start** to fight the House Cat.  
The big owner invades!  
They pee and have sex. Feline Infection!  
They **realize** they don’t mind the cars, that much anyways.  
If they **can** only **get** Tommy to **stop trying** an insurrection.  
Bass drum. High hat. Scratch. Crash! Ride.
