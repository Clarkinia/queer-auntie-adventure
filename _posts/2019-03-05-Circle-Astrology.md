<h5>Companion Plants</h5>
In 2003 I started volunteering at City Slicker Farms, an urban farm that has been at the forefront of the food justice movement. Back then it was a couple of single-lot farms and a handful of backyard gardens. I often worked alongside Willow Rosenthal, who showed me the basics of urban farming. At first, I was all fired up to pull every last weed to help the plants grow more efficiently. That’s when Willow taught me about companion planting, a practice of creating a habitat by allowing different plants (including “weeds”) to grow next to each other. These plant pairings help each other grow better and protect each other from pests.

These next few weeks, you will be weeding through your companions, deciding which you’re ready to pull and which to root in deeper with. People from your past will resurface, if they haven’t already. As you re-acquaint yourselves, you will re-consider these relationships. Depending on where Pisces is in your chart, this can cover your chosen family, your soul pod, creative collaborators, mentors, neighbors, social media friends, co-workers or people with shared investments. You will be face-to-face with deciding which binds you want to break free of and which lasting commitments you want to make last.

<h5>Everyone's favorite astrological topic</h5>
For all you draculas who have been cringe-fully jogging in the park in the middle of the day wondering when all these direct planets will shift, adjust your fangs because at long last we have mercury going retrograde! Get ye to a velvety coffin and let the introspective games begin.

And for those outward-energy care bears who fear retrogrades, you’ll be fine I’m sure. After all you have plenty of car karaoke and celebrity dance shows to get you through the minefield of paper cuts that is retrogrades (me shudders with joy).

A lil astro tip: don’t fret about the merc retro: it’s good for retracing steps: getting a second chance to learn and doing inner work. (triple salcolon, never done before)

Mercury retrograding in Pisces is high vibes and you can get a lot of power from following that flickering light of intuition. Do not ignore your body, heart and soul messages. Get with that inner voice.

Even though you may feel harried by some of these repeated circumstances and people coming back into your life, they are likely something you recently asked for. There is a reason you're trying this out again. Ask yourself why you want this; don’t be afraid to sit with that feeling. The reason might be foggy, but true, and you just have to follow it a bit. But if you sit with it and know it's wrong, then by all means say no.

Everything you do, do it from that vulnerable gut trust place of not needing to have it all figured out now. Trust that it will make sense in the end. Particularly for this whole month it's delicate high vibes so it's easy to get panicked and wish it made more sense. Unhealthy expression of Pisces gets sneaky, martyry, resentful, evasive, touchy, emo and victimy. Especially with the sun in Pisces, watch for a humble-brag show of compassionate and sensitive Piscean traits.

Touch in with how you and everyone alive is in a vulnerable spot. Feel, listen and trust the quiet voice inside. Enjoy the different perspective while it lasts.
